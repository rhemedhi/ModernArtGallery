#This website showcase the design of beautiful portraits made by the Modern Art Gallery. 

#This project was built using HTML5 and CSS3 and was deployed through git to github pages using the git commands below;
[
git init (initializing the git)

git add . (adding all my files to be tracked)

git status (to check if all the files added are tracked)

git commit -m “gallery website” (committing to my files with the name “gallery website”)

git remote add origin “link from github” (connecting my git to github servers remotely)

git push origin -u main (uploading my files into my repository)

NB: This is how I did mine despite the different methods of pushing your files on github repository.]


#Upon loading the website, a picture of a man and a woman staring at a portrait appears which covers the whole view height of the page.

#Scroll down to see the grid of some other beautiful portraits.

#At the end of the website page is a black background footer which contains the social media handles of the Modern Art Gallery where you can contacts us and also find more portraits to choose from.

#There is a location button on the first page for both laptops and tablets, whereas for a mobile phones you will see the location button below when you scroll down the page.

#Upon clicking on the location button appears a location page which shows the exact location of the Modern Gallery Website on a map. Click on the location pin to see the exact location of the Modern Art Gallery.

#On that same page, below the map, you can get the exact location of the Modern Art Gallery in a black background color. Use this to locate us if you are not familiar with the use of the map.

#Below the location information, you can still find our social media there and interact with us.


#The creation of the website was interesting. My challenges were in designing the hovering state of the button, where the text side and the chevron right icon both change color simultaneously as the button is hovered over. Finally, it was designed so that the text side and the chevron right icon both change color when you hover over the chevron right icon.
It was a pleasure to finish this beautiful website.
